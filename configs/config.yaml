integration:
  # DevLake Integration Configuration
  # DevLake is a data engineering platform that collects, transforms, and visualizes software development data.
  # This integration sends deployment events from ArgoCD applications to DevLake projects for DORA metrics tracking.
  #
  # How it works:
  # 1. When an ArgoCD application is deployed, the system extracts component name, revision, and commit history
  # 2. A deployment event is formatted according to DevLake's CICD deployment API format
  # 3. The deployment is sent to the global project (always) and any matching team projects
  # 4. DevLake processes these events to calculate DORA metrics (deployment frequency, lead time, etc.)
  #
  # Authentication: Requires DEVLAKE_WEBHOOK_TOKEN environment variable to be set
  devlake:
    enabled: true  # Set to false to disable DevLake integration
    base_url: "https://konflux-devlake-ui-konflux-devlake.apps.rosa.kflux-c-prd-i01.7hyu.p3.openshiftapps.com"  # DevLake instance URL
    project_id: "1"  # Global DevLake project ID - receives ALL deployment events from all components
    timeout_seconds: 30  # HTTP request timeout for DevLake API calls

    # Team Project Configuration
    # Teams allow routing deployments to team-specific DevLake projects in addition to the global project.
    # This enables teams to have their own DORA metrics dashboards while maintaining a global view.
    #
    # Deployment Routing Logic:
    # - Every deployment is ALWAYS sent to the global project (project_id above)
    # - If a component belongs to a team, the deployment is ALSO sent to that team's project
    # - A component can belong to multiple teams (deployment sent to all matching team projects)
    # - If a component doesn't match any team, it only goes to the global project
    #
    # Example: If "build-service" component is deployed:
    # - Sent to global project (project_id: "1")
    # - Sent to team-platform project (project_id: "2") if build-service is in team-platform's argocd_components
    teams:
      # Example team configuration
      # - name: "team-platform"  # Human-readable team name for logging
      #   project_id: "2"  # DevLake project ID for this team's metrics dashboard
      #   argocd_components:  # List of ArgoCD component names that belong to this team
      #     - "build-service"  # Component name as extracted from ArgoCD application name
      #     - "crossplane-control-plane"
      # - name: "team-ui"
      #   project_id: "3"
      #   argocd_components:
      #     - "konflux-ui"
      #     - "konflux-info"
       - name: "konflux-ui"
         project_id: "3"
         argocd_components:
           - "konflux-ui"
           - "konflux-info"
